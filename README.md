# CIPper: The C Interview Prepper

Before a round of technical interviews, I tend to find myself repeating
the same exercises I've done for a previous round, often rewriting the unit
tests. After this round of interviews, I thought I'd upload the tests I used
for prepping for interviews in C (along with sample solutions), in case they're
of use for someone else preparing for a technical interview. I make no claim
that the sample solutions are optimal (I deliberately limited how long I took
for implementation), but they should at least be *a* correct implementation for
each data structure or algorithm. Pull requests welcome!

For interview prep, I'd encourage you to clone this repository, empty out the
header and source files (or at least the source files) and try writing
something that satisfies the given tests. Go out there and
[win one with the CIPper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CCwxMvXPZo)!
